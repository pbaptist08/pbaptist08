# Hi, I'm Prashanth 👋

Professionally born in data, polished in consulting and happiest in product!

## Why this GitHub profile?

This space is **deliberately focused on learning and sharing**, not polished case studies.

- It’s where I **learn modern AI concepts in public** as a PM.  
- It’s a place to **share my thinking and experiments**, and hopefully learn from others doing similar work.

Most of my “serious product work” lives in private company repos; this is the **open notebook** part of my craft.

## Learning Phase

 🧠 **1. How I think about the AI stack?** 
 A simple 5-layer mental model of the LLM stack for PMs 👉 [AI-Stack](https://github.com/pbaptist08/AI-systems-stack)
 
---
 🧪 **2. How I’m learning each layer in practice**   
Small, focused app Turns “random ingredients in my kitchen” into a usable recipe [Recipe-Rescuer](https://pb-recipe-rescuer.lovable.app)
  
  - V0 – Prompting & structured outputL Prompt-only backend, clear system prompt, constrained output format, and manual test cases to tune behavior.  
  - V1 – RAG v1 (Supabase KB + embeddings):Curated recipe rules and patterns stored in Supabase with embeddings; retrieved context is injected into the prompt so recipes are grounded in the KB.  
  - V2 – RAG v2 (docs/PDFs as knowledge):Extend the knowledge base with cookbook-style docs/PDFs and see how retrieval over longer, messier content changes answers.  
  - V3 – Orchestration and light agent behavior:Simple multi-step flow: interpret user request → retrieve context → generate recipe → optionally generate shopping list or variations.  
  - V4 – Evaluation and observability: Offline eval set (edge cases and safety cases), prompt regression checks, and basic logging/tracing of prompts, context, and responses.

### 3. What’s next 🔭

More **stack-aligned projects**, All new projects will follow the same pattern:
> **Start with a clear mental model → build a small, focused app → document what was learned, as a PM, at each layer of the stack.**
