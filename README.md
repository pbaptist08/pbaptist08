# Hi, I'm Prashanth 👋

Senior product manager who loves turning messy real-world data and constraints into AI-powered products that actually ship and move the needle.

## Why this GitHub profile?

This space is **deliberately focused on learning and sharing**, not polished case studies.

- It’s where I **learn modern AI concepts in public** as a PM.  
- It’s a place to **share my thinking and experiments**, and hopefully learn from others doing similar work.

Most of my “serious product work” lives in private company repos; this is the **open notebook** part of my craft.

## Learning Phase

### 🧠 1. How I think about the AI stack?
A simple 5-layer mental model of the LLM stack for PMs 👉 

---
### 🧪 2. How I’m learning each layer in practice   
Small, focused apps where I practice prompting, RAG, and UX decisions against real constraints.

- 🍳 **Recipe Rescuer – From Prompting to RA**  
  Turns “random ingredients in my kitchen” into a usable recipe, evolving from prompt-only to Supabase-backed RAG.  
  🌐 [Live app](TODO: add live link)

### 3. What’s next 🔭

More **stack-aligned projects**, All new projects will follow the same pattern:
> **Start with a clear mental model → build a small, focused app → document what was learned, as a PM, at each layer of the stack.**
