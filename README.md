## Why this GitHub profile?

This space is **deliberately focused on learning and sharing**, not polished case studies.

- It’s where I **learn modern AI concepts in public** as a PM.  
- It’s a place to **share my thinking and experiments**, and hopefully learn from others doing similar work.

---

## Learning Phase

### 1. How I think about the AI stack 🧠

A simple 5-layer mental model that helps reason from infra and models up to real product UX and metrics.

- 🗺️ **LLM Stack – Learning Map (for PMs)**  
  👉 [View the learning map](TODO: add link to the AI stack repo or file)

---

### 2. How I’m learning each layer in practice 🧪

Small, focused projects that exercise specific layers of the stack and force real trade-offs, not just theory.

#### 🍳 Recipe Rescuer – From Prompting to RAG

A small web app that turns “random ingredients in my kitchen” into a usable recipe.

- **Links**
  - 📂 **Code & docs:** [Recipe Rescuer repository](TODO: add repo link)  
  - 🌐 **Live app (Lovable):** [Open the app](TODO: add live link)

---

All new projects will follow the same pattern:

> **Start with a clear mental model → build a small, focused app → document what was learned, as a PM, at each layer of the stack.**
